# Rell

A simple (and maybe poorly named) shell emulator written in rust for learning purposes.

## To run
First off, make sure you have an up to date version of rust.
`rustup update`

For easy use simply run :
`cargo build`

If you are looking to build a slightly optimized release version:
Then build the target executable.
`cargo build --release`

And finally run the executable.
`./target/release/rell`
